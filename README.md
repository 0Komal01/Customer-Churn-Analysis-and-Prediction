## 🔹 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer churn in the telecom industry and builds a predictive model to identify customers likely to leave. It also calculates **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)** and identifies high-value customers at risk, providing actionable insights to improve retention strategies.  

---

## 🔹 Features

- ✅ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning  
  - Handling missing values and converting categorical variables  
- ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
  - Customer demographics, tenure distribution, and churn analysis  
  - Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- ✅ Customer Segmentation  
  - Segmenting customers based on tenure, monthly charges, and contract type  
- ✅ Churn Prediction Model  
  - Logistic Regression for predicting churn  
  - Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix  
- ✅ Lifetime Value (LTV) Analysis  
  - Identifying high-value customers at risk of churning

## 🔹 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- scikit-learn (Machine Learning)

---

## 🔹 Key Insights

- Customers with **short tenure** and **high monthly charges** are more likely to churn.  
- **Month-to-month contract holders** show higher churn rates.  
- Logistic Regression model achieved **79% accuracy** in predicting churn.  
- **High-value, at-risk customers** are identified for targeted retention strategies.
